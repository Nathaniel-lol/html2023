        <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
            <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
            <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="img_selector.gif" alt="">
        <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to. <br>
            <br>
            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>
            <br>
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br>
            <br>
            Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
