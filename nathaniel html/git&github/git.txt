What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that
tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually
used for coordinating work among programmers who are
collaboratively developing source code during software
development.

It is used for:

1. tracking code changes
2. tracking who made changes
3. coding collaborations

What does Git do?

1. manage projects with repositories.
2. clone a project to work on a local copy.
3. control and track changes with staging and committing.
4. branch and merge to allow fr work on different parts 
and versions of a project.
5. pulls the latest version of the main product to
a local copy.
6. push local updates to the main project.

Working with Git:

1. initialize Git on a folder, making it repository
Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of
changes in that folder
2. when a file is changed, added or deleted,
it is considered modified
3. you select the modified files you want to stage
4. The staged files are committed, 
which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of
the files.
5. Git allows you to see the full history of every
commit.
6. you can revert back to any previous commit.
7. Git does not store a separate copy of every 
file in every commit, but keeps track of changes
made in each commit!
